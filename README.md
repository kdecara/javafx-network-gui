# javafx-network-gui
A GUI built using JavaFX to display different graph algorithms
This is a GUI I built in JavaFX partly to learn JavaFX and partly as a creative programming project to display different graph algorithms such as Djilstra's Shortest Path, Primm's algorithm, Kruskals's, and so on. As of the initialy upload, only Djikstra's is implemented

# About the packages
The main file is NetowrkGUI.java which depends on packages from the GrahElements package, which consists of interfaces used as a blueprint for creating elements on the graph, and the Utility package, which contains things like classes that allow for creating a name for each node, Lexicon, and a Pair useful for tracking a Node and its tentative distance.
