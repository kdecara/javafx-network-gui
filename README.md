# javafx-network-gui
A GUI built using JavaFX to display different graph algorithms
This is a GUI I built in JavaFX partly to learn JavaFX and partly as a creative programming project to display different graph algorithms such as Djilstra's Shortest Path, Primm's algorithm, Kruskals's, and so on. However, as of the initialy upload, only Djikstra's is written.

# About
The main file is NetowrkGUI.java, to run it you just need a java compiler. The GrahElements package consists of interfaces and classes used as a blueprint for creating elements on the graph.The Utility Package contains things like classes that allow for creating a name for each node, which I called Lexicon, and a Pair useful for tracking a Node and it's tentative distance.
